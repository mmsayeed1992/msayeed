    <p>One of the most absurd fun facts that is actually true is that you could walk from Russia to Alaska on ice in the winter time on a 3.8km journey. Just because this trip is possible, doesn't mean it's alright to do in terms of immigration laws. It is not even safe due to strong ocean winds with extremely cold and icy conditions.

        <br>Now that I have your attention, a little about me. 
    </p>

    <p> I'm originally from Pakistan, born and raised there until I was fourteen years of age. I then immigrated to Canada with my family where I finished junior high, high school, and university education. I successfully graduated from the University of Calgary with a degree in Finance & Economics within five years, rather than the usual six, while balancing a full-time work schedule. Throughout my life, I have developed a great deal of motivation for technology projects to drive innovation. However, many aspects of my computer science knowledge were still missing, which is why I enrolled myself in the Master of Engineering in CS program in 2021 at Tufts University. But I have also always had an aptitude for higher studies.
    <br>
    <br>From a career perspective, I moved to Texas from Canada after graduation to start my first job in investment banking. I worked at Goldman Sachs (GS) in the operations division for a few years where I learned the importance of process improvements outside of my regular finance role. I was involved in many projects in both back-office and front-office user experience where I helped build applications and processes within the corporate & credit loan space. I worked with many cross-functional teams to further develop my passion for technological and software applications, while also understanding financial products in a non-tech capacity. Being involved in operational projects at one of the largest investment banks was my initial exposure to the IT field. It allowed me to understand the technology scene and utilize my knowledge as a finance undergraduate to benefit the organization.
    <br>
    <br>Afterwards, I decided to take a wild step to get out of finance industry to experience more of a technology industry sector and got a job at Amazon in Seattle where I became more involved and found myself at the forefront of such a fun and non-finance environment. My experiences at Amazon, in an operational capacity (in regards to product and process improvements), gave me a great deal of insight into the world of software development. 
    <br>
    <br>Due to personal and family reasons, I moved back to Texas and started working at Meta (formally known as Facebook). This is also where I aspire to be even more involved in software related projects with an aim of developing optimizable and scalable solutions into the social networking business.
    <br>
    <br>Since graduating university in Canada, I have made a personal goal to visit at least one new country every year during the vacation/PTO time I get from my corporate job. It has been 8 years since graduation and I have been to 15 countries so far; Pakistan, Canada, US, Mexico, Italy, Croatia, Germany, Czech, Spain, Denmark, Turkey, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Palestine.
    <br>
    <br>Keeping up with my health is also important to me, so outside of trying to maintain a well-balanced diet, I go to OrangeTheory for exercise a few times a week, which is a HIIT workout program.
